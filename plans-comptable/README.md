# Plans comptables

_Briefly, in English:_

For those not in France, the background is that French law legislates
the basics of a chart of accounts for entities that interact with the
state (so, most).  This seems insane at first to outsiders, but does
have the advantage of consistency: it's easier for accountants and
auditors to come up to speed on a company's books if the chart of
accounts is already familiar.
